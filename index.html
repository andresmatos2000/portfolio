        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Shopify Product Fetch</h3>

        <h3>Shopify Order App</h3>
        <p>This project allows me to take sales data from shopify and output the ammount this table, showing our vendors how much they made last month</p>

        <p>The last project I'll show takes the product list from shopify, creates a sku for each product, and renames the products on my computer to match</p>
        <h3>Shopify Sku App</h3>
        <img src="Images/Sku.PNG" />
        <p>All of this runs on my computer but go to <a href="www.backdropstock.com">Backdropstock.com</a> and check out the site</p>
